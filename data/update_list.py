# NOTES
# Order of data to update is VERY IMPORTANT! Larger strings should be placed higher in the dictionary.
# Capitalization and special symbols are important too. Either include lower case examples as well or change the main.py file to convert everything to lower() before updating with new strings.


# This is a dictionary to update old strings to their new counterparts
